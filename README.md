# 🧭 Java Learning Journey — roadmap.sh Projects

> A collection of hands-on Java projects built while following the [roadmap.sh Java Developer](https://roadmap.sh/java) path.  
> This repository documents my practical progress — from language fundamentals to advanced backend development with modern Java technologies.

---

## 🎯 Goal
This repository serves as a structured portfolio of all the Java projects I’ve developed while studying each stage of the **Java Developer Roadmap**.  
Each folder represents a specific learning milestone, containing projects, notes, and experiments that helped me master Java step by step.
